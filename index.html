                Some things about me
            </h1>
            <p>
                I was born in Vietnam. Living for 16 years, I decided to study in Canada. Now, I am
                a student who is taking CIT course at BCIT. I enjoy playing online game
                during my free time. However, it <em>consumes</em>
                me a lot of time. My current favorite course that I am taking at BCIT is 
                <strong>ACIT-1620</strong>
